      <p>
        My name as you may have already guessed is Christopher I currently work
        as a field service technician for Willscot Detroit, but I have 10 years
        of experience as a Low Voltage Communications technician. I have
        recently found a passion in technology. I recently built my first
        computer, on which I enjoy playing video games. I have decided I want to
        make a career change. So, I am currently teaching myself coding,
        specifically Python and Django as well as some JavaScript, and now this
        Web Essentials in HTML and CSS. My goal is to someday start my own web
        developement agency, to offer clients a wide array of web services: from
        simple landing pages to complicated e-commerce functionality, along with
        the future possibilty of mobile app developement as well.

        >I am a father to two wonderful children, Alexander and Lorelai. My
        wife, Anna, and I are expecting our third child, Henrik in June.
        Together we have two dogs, Mallory and Koda. We also have two cats,
        Kitten Mittens, and Shadow. My wife and I also practice photography and
        plan to start our own business soon. As a family we thouroughly enjoy
        the outdoors from camping and hiking, to kayaking and skiing. I want to
        change careers so that I can have more freedom of time to enjoy my
        family and to better provide for them. We are also a bunch of nerds. We
        enjoy video games, board games, and even play Dungeons and Dragons
        together as a family.</strong
